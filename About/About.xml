	<description>Text-to-Speech extension for RimTalk that brings your colonists' voices to life!

This mod captures dialogue generated by RimTalk and converts it to speech using Fish Audio API. Features include:

• Real-time speech synthesis for all RimTalk dialogues
• Per-pawn voice model configuration
• Translation support for multilingual speech
• Automatic dialogue blocking until speech is ready
• Synchronized cancellation when RimTalk ignores dialogue
• Configurable voice parameters (temperature, top_p)
• Volume control

Requirements:
• RimTalk must be installed and enabled
• Python 3.9+ with fish-audio-sdk package installed
• Fish Audio API key (get yours at https://fish.audio/)
• Voice reference ID (can be found on fish audio website by clicking "share" button of the voice model you want to add, then delete "https://fish.audio/m/") for speech generation
• It is recommended to disable "Allow Simultaneous Conversations" setting in Rimtalk

Setup:
1. Enable both RimTalk and RimTalk TTS mods
2. Get your Fish Audio API key
3. Configure TTS settings in mod options
4. Assign voice models to your colonists

This mod operates non-invasively through Harmony patches and does not modify RimTalk's core code.
